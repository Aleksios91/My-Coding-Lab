# My Coding Playgrouind
Hello and welcome to my Coding Repository! 
In here, I'll be sharing programming scripts I've written across various languages — from Python to JavaScript and more. These are projects born from curiosity, self-teaching, and raw determination. I may not have a formal degree, nor experioence, but I do have **drive**, **discipline**, and a love for problem-solving.

## 💻 What You’ll Find Here

This is a mixed bag of experiments, small utilities, and projects I’ve done to improve my skills or solve everyday problems. Some are functional tools, some are practice runs — all are part of my learning journey.




## 🧠 Why This Exists

I created this space to:
- Share what I’m learning with others
- Track my own growth as a self-taught dev
- Offer help to beginners who might stumble across these scripts
- One day show potential employers my progress and passion

## 🔓 License / Use

All scripts here are free to use. No complicated license stuff — if you find them helpful, feel free to tweak them, copy them, or build on top. If you have feedback, I’d love to hear it.

I believe in **open learning** and **community over competition**.

## 💬 Want to Connect?

If you're someone who values self-taught journeys, creativity, or are just looking to exchange ideas, feel free to reach out or connect with me on [LinkedIn](your-link-here). I'm also exploring ways to collaborate and grow.

Thanks for stopping by.
